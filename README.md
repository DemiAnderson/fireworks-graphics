# fireworks-graphics
In this repo I want to refactor one of my oldest scripts - simple fireworks GUI based on the turtle library.

# how to launch
from root directory use the terminal command:
```
python fireworks/main.py
```

By default the fireworks size is from 20 to 30 sparks, but if you wish to change the size of the show, use the flag:
```
python fireworks/main.py - s 20-30
```
